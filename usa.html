    <h3>How the USA is being affected by Climate Change:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Warmer temperature will increase due to the climate change that is occurring in the United States of
        America. Additionally, these warmer temperatures will increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat
        waves which are very detrimental to human and animal health, particularly for young children and the elderly.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Climate change can also impact human health by worsening air and water quality which would increase the
        spread of fatal disease, altering the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Climate change will also foster the growth of sea levels, rising them by a tremendous amount. These
        unexpected rising sea levels will threaten costal communities and ecosystems.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Climate change will also alter the patterns and the amounts of rainfaill due to more water evaporating
        because of the global temberatures also rising. This will change the timing and amount of stream flow,
        affecting water supplies and water quality and the production of hydroelectricity.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Climate change will also influence geographic ranges of many plant and animal species. Meaning, the timing
        of their life cycle events, such as migration and reproduction will be latered.</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Finally, there will be frequent occurrencee of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, and
        floods. This will increase losses to property which will result in disruptions to society and reduce the
        affordability of insurance for many individuals all across the nation.</li>
      </ol>

        <h3>How the USA contributes to climate change:</h3>
        <p>In the first graph, it shows the emission values different activities produce in the United States of
          America. However, for a more general answer, human activites are responsible for almost all of the increase
          in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 eyars. Moreover, the largest source of greenhouse
          gas emissions from human activities in the United States of America is from burning fossil fuels for heat,
          transportation, and electricity.</p>

        <h3>The Environmental policies set in place by USA           Government:</h3>
        <p>According to the White House (whitehouse.gov), they             are planning the folllwing things: </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li> Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% below           2005 levels in 2030. </li>
          <p></p>
          <li> Reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by             2035. </li>
          <p></p>
          <li> Achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li> Deliver 40% of the benefits from federal   investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantages
            communities.</li>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some other ways to take climate action in YOUR                   community is by fidning out how the Inflation Reduction
            Act works, how to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law works, and how you can join the President's American
            Climate Corps which is seeking to put a new, diverse generation of Americans to work on conserving our
            lands and waters to enhance our community in all.</p>
