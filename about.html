    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p class='special'>We are all Kode With Klossy alumni who met each other during the 2024 online Data Science camp! We all learned so much and had a blast working on this project together. We chose to research climate change and its impacts on different regions of the world because not everyone is affected in the same way. It all stemmed from our shared interest in environmental advocacy, education, and protecting our natural resources!
